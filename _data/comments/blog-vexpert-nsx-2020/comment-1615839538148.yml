message: "I'm a humble chef, however, Let me try to properly formulate my thoughts about the film, because it is so dear to my heart. \r\n \r\nIf men using a revolver gets from the train from the prologue of Sergio Leone's film, then he has to have something to say. The silent wanderer looks after a bitter story deep in the heart, his secret weighs heavily on his soul. However, even being sentimental in moments of relative solitude, the traveler is decisive, and in their eyes you will observe anger containing accumulated within the years. He is not who he seems. The wanderer's name is Douglas Mortimer, an ancient military man and today a bounty hunter. If viewers on the film listen on the words of the flabby old man chained with a bed (a funny grandpa appears closer for the core of the film), they'll learn the fact that trains, these damned and noisy objects, are at fault for everything. Alas, but earthly hardships will not be limited by trains and Douglas Mortimer is knowledgeable of this, his problem involves bones, flesh and blood. The, played by Lee Van Cleef, cherishes the soul with thoughts of revenge, but besides revenge is the primary focus from the plot of Sergio Leone's brainchild, because in addition to the retired colonel, there is another hero within the film. Fast, accurate, discreet, another bounty hunter. No less than curious, but at most wildly interesting, especially if the “one-armed” shooter is played by Bruce Lee in the realm of Westerns - Clint Eastwood. It's easy to guess that the paths of Mortimer plus the nameless shooter will cross in the sun on the wild west. The spaghetti is already from the pot. \r\n \r\nIn A Few Dollars More, phrases like “in ten minutes you're going to be smoking in hell” or “you will need a new sheriff” are inevitable. The hero of Clint Eastwood is shown to be a shooter whose abilities is relevant in a very science fiction novel, but all of that is alleged cannot be attributed on the disadvantages of your narrative. Perhaps the most absurd moments while in the Western genre and in the skillful direction of Sergio Leone become salt for spaghetti, and situation from the partnership between One-Handed and Colonel Mortimer tenaciously keeps viewers at the screens, which are usually visited by such thoughts: ¬¬ “I ponder what can happen further? Will One-Armed and Colonel Mortimer find common ground? ” “A few bucks more” - shootings, chases, music of contributions, personifying next of death, here satire, in addition to foolishness, lives side-by-side with drama and ironically interpreted religious motives. And, finally, situation shown by Sergio Leone would be the archetype of assorted paintings, where partnerships flow into friendship, though into a kind of friendship, within this friendship somebody can shoot a buddy from the neck to ensure he isn't killed with the thugs of the ultimate boss. The fire is burning within the pan. The spaghetti begins to boil. \r\n \r\nSergio Leone's tape is actually a classic with the genre, and this really is clear to see by the noise of bullets fired by the heroes, bank robberies as well as the long glances that two shooters exchange ahead of the decisive shot, that shot that decides human destiny. The creators not merely highlight their creation (and they generally do it well), but will also touch on burning topics in a few episodes of the film, not afraid to scoff at corrupt politicians and cunning businessmen, using original script moves. Furthermore, it really is in excess of interesting to enjoy a lot of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef - the heroes of the existing and new generation of westerns who, being in the photos of Manco (One-armed) and Colonel Mortimer, now and then prove something to each other, competing within the possession of a revolver and doing of sieve hats. Hmm, something's heating up in the kitchen area, phew, it's time to serve spaghetti around the table. Winnie, the attendees are waiting, hurry up, they can be hungry and began to taste Leone's signature spaghetti. It's difficult for an expressive chef to find a good helper these days. Spaghetti is served, but wait a minute, dear guests. \r\n \r\nUndoubtedly, Sergio Leone in his “A Few Dollars More” demonstrates to cinema the lion's share of his talent and professionalism, and the photo itself can be considered hypertrophied dominating before the primary film of your trilogy, which attracted a person's eye with the expressive Akira Kurosawa. A long time later, Leone's brainchild efforts to please numerous people, as well as film succeeds: those viewers who desires a dramatic story have it, those that love shooting and duels are satisfied, and connoisseurs of satirical humor are going to be satisfied after watching. Straightforward music, it is possible to speak briefly - Ennio Morricone. Dear listeners, perhaps My business is too excited, making my head a little bit confused, but in the event you watch a terrific film of my fellow countryman one or more times, you're going to be convinced of the correctness of my words. However, I can't hide my bias, I truly love the stories about the shooters of your wild west, where there's two totally different bounty hunters chasing the identical victim, however, not precisely the same motives. Oh, I almost forgot, season with spaghetti sauce and garnish with basil. Looks pretty good. Enjoy your meal! \r\n \r\nhttps://www.123moviessdsasas.com"
