My name is Ricardo AdÃ£o and this blog is my way of contributing to the tech community by sharing some pieces of knowledge and rare _light bulb_ moments.

I have been working in the IT industry for more years than care to admit.

My journey through IT covers Software Development, Security, Network and for the last couple of years Virtualization, mainly VMware was focused.

I currently work as a VMware Product Engineer _@[Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/)_.
