## Welcome to vRandomBites blog ##

My name is Ricardo Ad√£o and decided to start blogging my random pieces of "wisdom".

I have been working in the IT industry for more years than I feel comfortable to admit.

My journey through IT covers Software Development, Security, Network and for the last couple of years Virtualization and VMware was the main area of focus.I currently work as a VMware Product Engineer _@[Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/)_.

My posts in this blog represent my random technical notes and thoughts.

The thoughts expressed here do not reflect my current employer in any way.
