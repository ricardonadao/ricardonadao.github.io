My name is Ricardo Ad√£o and this blog is my way of contributing to the tech community by sharing some pieces of knowledge and rare _light bulb_ moments.

I have been working in the IT industry for more years than care to admit.

My journey through IT covers a lot of skills and roles from Software Development, Security, Network and for the last couple of years Virtualization, mainly VMware technologies.

After a couple of years working [_@Rackspace_](https://www.rackspace.com/) in the _VMware_ side of the house, the opportunity of moving to [_@VMware_](https://www.vmware.com/) was an hard challenge to refuse.

Which turns me a  _VMware_ employee since May 2019, I joined the _NEMEA PSO team_ as a _NSX Senior Consultant_.

The thoughts expressed here do not reflect my current employer in any way.
