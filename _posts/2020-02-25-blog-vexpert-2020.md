I am happy to inform that got another star in the _vExpert_ ladder.

It has been a crazy couple of months with a lot of of things to blog about without an huge amount of time to write them, but balancing it a bit with some extra activity in _Slack_ helping out the community.

The _vExpert_ program gives you access to multiple perks and resources, however the biggest perk/asset is the access to the fantastic people that form the _vExpert_ community.

Definitely happy to be part of it for one more year.
