As you probably know support for NFS v4.1 has been added starting with vSphere 6. Is a big deal?Looking at the additional features and functionalties that NFS v4.1 provides over NFS version 3, I think it's a big deal indeed!

Add to that the fact that we have now moved to 10G network connections as standard and the cheaper SSD-cached shared storage, I believe it's the perfect timing for NFS to up it's game so that an NFS datastore is on par with a VMFS datastore!
<h1>What's new with NFS v4.1</h1>
Let's have a look at the new capabilities introduces by NFS 4.1 with vSphere 6.5

NFS v4.1 now includes hardware acceleration, this will allow your hosts to offload specific virtual machine and storage management operations to storage.

Your mounts are now secured as kerberos is now supported

NFS v4.1 provides multipathing and load-Balancing via the use of multiple IP addresses to access a single NFS volume

NFS v4.1 also fully supports IPv6.
<h1>Caveats</h1>
As with everything else NFS v4.1 does come with some caveats. Datastores that are mounted using NFS version 4.1 do not support SDRS, SIOC, SRM, or Virtual Volumes. One last thing, datastore upgrades from NFS version 3 to version 4.1 is not supported.
