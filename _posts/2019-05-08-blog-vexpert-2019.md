After a big break on the blogging, for really good personal reasons, lets get back to it by starting with some _house cleaning_.

It seems that the _vExpert 2018_ award was not a mistake and _VMware_ kept me in the _vExpert_ list once again.

The _vExpert_ program gives you access to multiple perks and resources, however the biggest perk/asset is the access to the fantastic people that form the _vExpert_ community.

Definitely happy to be part of it for one more year.
